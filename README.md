#### Supported Platforms
Following platforms are supported by Electron:

**macOS**
The minimum version supported is macOS 10.9.

**Windows**
Windows 7 and later are supported

**Linux:**

- Ubuntu 12.04 and later
- Fedora 21
- Debian 8

[More information](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/supported-platforms.md).

Note that on Linux, some users might experience a GPU bug where the select options rendered as a black box, see [issue #128 of Manta](https://github.com/hql287/Manta/pull/128) and [issue #4322 of Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4322). This can be fixed by disabling hardware acceleration like so:

```sh
manta --disable-hardware-acceleration
```

> Remember that doing this might lead to some degradation of the app's performance. This is why "the fix" is not included by default.

### Why
The main reason I decided to build this is because I need a simple tool to create good looking invoices, estimates, and receipts but couldn't find one  that suits my needs. I don't do invoicing for a living but I do need it occasionally so an ideal invoicing app just needs to be good at one thing and one thing only, which is making invoices. I really don't need a full-fledged bookkeeping or accounting software.

I believe there are many people such as freelance designers, developers, photographers or writers... also have such need. However, most (if not all) products I found have these these problems:

**Complexity**

* Most invoicing products nowadays is web-based, which means you’ll need to maintain a new account (possible a monthly fee, too) just to create an invoice.
* Sure, there some open-source products that can be self-hosted, but that will introduce a new layer of complexity to your workflow. Who will setup the product? Who will maintain the server? Who will cover the cost? ...
* You will always need internet connection to be able to create your invoices. It can be slow sometimes.

**Privacy**

* When you use a web service, most of the time, you’re giving away your data whether you want it or not. Financial data is sensitive and I believe that no one should know about your data except yourself.


### Goals
With that in mind, I know that Manta would need to satisfy these criteria:

* 🚀 Fast!!!
* 👍 Friendly UI & UX
* 🎉 Has nice looking templates
* 🔒 Does not touch user’s data
* 💰 Free! :)

  If you think Manta delivers these, let me know by putting a star on this project 😉

### Development

It's very easy to get started with these 3 steps:

* Clone this project to your local machine.
* Open terminal and `cd` into the cloned folder, usually `cd Manta`.
* Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
* Run `yarn dev` in one tab to start `webpack-dev-server`.
* Run `yarn start` in another tab to open the app.

This is still in beta and it's far from perfect so feedbacks, issues or PRs are greatly appreciated! :)

Note that on Linux you will need additional dependencies to provide the `icns2png` and `gm` commands.
Ubuntu/Debian users can run: `sudo apt install -y icnsutils graphicsmagick`.

### FAQ

* **Is this app built with Electron?**

Yes, it's built on top of [Electron](#). Please see the [Technologies](#technologies) section for more info.

* **What boilerplate did you use**

None. This is my attempt to integrate Electron with React from scratch. The idea was to get a better understanding of how things work together, especially Webpack.
But I do take cue from other projects.

* **What CSS/UI Framework did you use?**

I wrote all the CSS myself. I only use Bootstrap for prototyping at first. But I gradually encapsulate most of the style to the component with the help of [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/). There is some places still use Bootstrap mostly for layout purpose but I'll get rid of it eventually.

* **Where did you get the icons?**

[ionicons](http://ionicons.com/). They're great!

* **Why did you name the project Manta? It has nothing to do with invoicing.**

It's actually very common to associate an animal with your brand. There's a reason behind the Twitter bird, the famous MailChimp Freddy or the Docker whale ... It's called the Baby-Face bias. You can read more about it in the book [Designing for Emotion](https://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion) by [Aaron Walter](http://aarronwalter.com/).
In my case, I was inspired by the movie [Racing Extinction](http://racingextinction.com/) and by naming this project Manta, I hope to raise people's awareness on some environmental issues mentioned in the movie. You can [read more about it here](https://usemanta.app/about/)

* **I like Manta's logo, did you design it?**

Yes, I actually did all the illustrations as well as the templates that you see in the app.

* **Are you available for hire?**

Yes, I'm exploring new opportunities at the moment. Please let me know what you have in mind.

* **How do I contact you?**

If you find an issue, please report it here. For everything else, please drop me a line at hi@usemanta.app
